# Darwin World

Darwin World is a simulation written in Java with a user interface built using JavaFX. The project represents an ecosystem where animals struggle for survival by eating plants, reproducing, and adapting through genotype mutations.

## Simulation Overview
The simulation models the evolution of an animal population in an environment where they must find food and cope with limited resources. Animals move around the map in search of food and survival opportunities. Different map versions can be selected, affecting movement and gameplay dynamics. Additionally, the application allows users to select a specific animal to track and monitor its statistics in real time.

The simulation models the evolution of an animal population in an environment where they must find food and cope with limited resources. Animals have the following characteristics:
- **Genotypes** – influencing their behavior and survival abilities,
- **Energy** – gained by eating plants and lost over time,
- **Reproduction** – occurring under certain conditions,
- **Mutations** – random changes in the genotype passed on to offspring,
- **Death** – occurring when an animal's energy reaches zero.

## Technologies
- **Java** – core simulation logic,
- **JavaFX** – user interface,
- **Maven/Gradle** – dependency management.
